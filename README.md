# ESP32 IoT Nightlight

Welcome to your first MicroPython IoT project! In this lesson, you'll connect your ESP32 board, program it to sense light, and control an LED from your web browser. You'll learn how to build a real Internet of Things (IoT) device that you can monitor and control from any device on your WiFi network.

## Getting Started

1. **Connect your ESP32** to your computer using a USB cable.

2. **Open this project folder** in VS Code.
   - *If you see this README, you have already completed this step!*
3. **Install the recommended extensions** if prompted:
   - Python
   - Pymakr
   - *Look for a message at the bottom right of VS Code and click "Install" if prompted.*
4. **Create a new folder** in this project (e.g., `nightlight`).
   - In the Explorer panel (usually on the left), right-click anywhere in the file list and select **New Folder**. Enter a name for your folder (e.g., `nightlight`) and press Enter.

5. Make your new folder a `pymakr` project. (This means it is a project for ESP32.)
   - In the Explorer, right-click your new folder. In the context menu, hover over `pymakr` and select **Create project in folder** to set it as your Pymakr project.
6. **Create a new file** in your folder called `nightlight.py`:
   - Right-click your folder and choose `New File`, then type `nightlight.py`.
7. **Open `nightlight.py` side-by-side with this README**:
   - Right-click the file and select `Open to the Side` or drag it to the right.

Your workspace should show:
- The Explorer (file list)
- This README in preview mode
- Your `nightlight.py` file for editing
